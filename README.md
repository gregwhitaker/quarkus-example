# quarkus-example
Simple example of a web service implemented with [Quarkus](http://quarkus.io).

This example shows you how to build and compile a simple "Hello World" RESTful webservice using Quarkus, GraalVM, and Gradle.

## Prerequisites
This example requires that you have the [GraalVM installed](https://github.com/oracle/graal/releases/tag/vm-19.2.1) on your development machine. 

**Note:** As of the time of this example Quarkus only supports GraalVM version `19.2.1`. Please refer to the [Quarkus](http://quarkus.io) website for information
on current GraalVM compatibility.

## Building the Example
Run the following command to build example:

    ./gradlew clean build
        
This will build the example as both an executable JAR and a native image using GraalVM.

For more detailed information check out the [Building Quarkus Apps with Gradle](https://quarkus.io/guides/gradle-tooling) documentation on the Quarkus website.

## Running the Example
Follow the steps below to run the example application:

1. Run the following commands to start the native image version of the application:

        cd build
        ./quarkus-example-0.1.0-runner
        
    If successful, you will see the following in the terminal:
    
        2019-12-04 15:23:59,587 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) quarkus-example 0.1.0 (running on Quarkus 1.0.1.Final) started in 0.009s. Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:8080
        2019-12-04 15:23:59,587 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Profile prod activated.
        2019-12-04 15:23:59,587 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Installed features: [cdi, resteasy, resteasy-jackson]

2. In a new terminal, run the following command to send an HTTP request to the service:

        curl http://localhost:8080/hello?name=Bob
    
    If successful, you will see a response similar to the following in the terminal:
    
        {"create_time":"2019-12-04 03:24:56","message":"Hello, Bob!"}
